## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About
Thanks for stopping by. I like to think of myself as a tinkerer. Like an inventor in his back workshop experimenting and trialling different things. Here you'll find different repos I'm working on at different states in the worshop.

### Projects
My current major project is a hybrid Note Taking / Voice memo app in Flutter, however is currently private.

### Favourites
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is one of my favourite tools to use. Most of my recent projects revolve around this platform including [Node Red Bible](https://github.com/sugarlata/node-red-contrib-bible-gateway).

### Interests
Outside of that I have an interest in Storm Chasing, Timelapse, Maps (Geospatial Data Mashups in Google Earth are a favourite), and anything cutting edge tech.
